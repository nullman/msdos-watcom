* Watcom GCC Programs for MS-DOS

  See the "Build and Run" sections of [[file:msdos-watcom.org][msdos-watcom.org]] to see how to build, clean,
  and run these applications using the DOSBox emulator. In general you follow
  these steps:

  Build with =make=.

  Clean with =make clean=.

  Run with =dosbox NAME.EXE=.

  All files are generated from [[file:msdos-watcom.org][msdos-watcom.org]] using Emacs' org-mode literate
  programming system to "tangle" them.

  root42's "Let's Code: MS-DOS" series was instrumental in creating these
  programs.
